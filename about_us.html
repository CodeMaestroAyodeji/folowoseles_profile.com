                    Basically, we can say that there are two major assignments the Lord has committed to our hands; these are to TEACH HIS WORD and to BUILD THE SPIRITUAL LIVES OF BELIEVERS.
                    The Lord has committed to us the ministry of reconciliation: reconciling the lost with the Father Who is interested in their return back to Him like the prodigal son. Then, they must be nurtured by God's word to build them to the image of Christ.
                    <br><br>
                    We got born again in the 80s. Then, being born again was not as popular as it is now. Those days, born again children of God were known as SUs; with reference to the SCRIPTURE UNION, which was a major and formidable society of true believers. Then, the people of the world used to refer to true believers as SUẸ̀GBẸ̀(fools) UNION members; we were not ashamed but always proud to belong to the "Jesus' gang".
                    <br><br>
                    Jesus made provisions for our spiritual growth by linking us up with REV. PAUL OYEDEJI ADEYEMO who was the Pastor of Salem Baptist Church, Modakeke in Osun State where we surrendered our lives to Christ. The Lord used Him to lay a good foundation for our lives. He taught us about studying THE WORD, PRAYER, FASTING, HUMILITY, BOLDNESS.
                    <br><br>
                    By the time we got admission to the Obafemi Awolowo University, we quickly joined the Baptist Students Fellowship which was another theological seminary on its own; the fellowship was a grooming, drilling and spiritual development center.
                    <br><br>
                    Our service year as youth corpers was majorly significant because of the rural rugged evangelism of the Christian Corpers' Fellowship. We can categorically say that without the evangelical programmes and crusades, the service year for us would have been a colossal failure and absolutely one full wasted year.
                    <br><br>
                    - We attended Ibadan Municipal Government (IMG) Primary School, Mokola, Ibadan from 1974 to 1980. We had brief touch at St. Gabriel's Secondary School, Mokola, Ibadan in 1980 before proceeding to Modakeke High School where we completed our secondary school in 1985. We proceeded to study Estate Management at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife between 1988 and 1994. We later attended the University of Lagos where we bagged a Master's Degree in Estate Management.
